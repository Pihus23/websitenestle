							<h3>Nestlé<small> Posted on July 14 </small></h3>
						</div>

						<p>The World's Largest Food and Beverages Company</p>

						<h4>The History</h4>

						<p><li>1860s - Henri Nestlé created one of the first baby formulas. He created a product that was a mixture of cow's milk, flour, and sugar. This was called Farine Lactée. This formula saved many infants lives and prevented them from being malnourished.</li>
							<li>1874 -Jules Monnerat bought the Nestlé company. Nestlé then created their own condensed milk to compete with the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company.</li>
							<li>1905 - Nestlé and The Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk formed a partnership and created factories in the United States, Britain, Spain, and Germany.</li>
							<li>1920s - Nestlé started forming powdered beverage products.</li>
							<li>1930s - Nescafé was created and became very popular.
						World War II made it hard for materials to be distributed and so profits decreased.</li>
							<li>1947 - Nestlé started partnering with companies that manufactured and produced soups and seasonings.</li>
							<li>	1960s and 1970s - Nescafé sales went up and they created a new kind of instant coffee.</li>
							<li>1980s - Nestlé was thriving and looking to expand the company.</li>
							<li>	1990s - Trade barriers were taken down and Nestlé was able to trade with parts of countries they couldn't before.</li>
							<li>Now - Nestlé is still growing and has $81 billion in sales.</li>
